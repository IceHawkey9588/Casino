void Dice\+::start\+Game (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}\item[{\textbf{ Player} \&}]{player}{}\end{DoxyParamCaption})}

Starts the dice game.

This function allows the player to play the dice game. It takes a reference to a \doxyref{Player}{p.}{class_player} object as a parameter. The player is prompted to enter their bet and choose what to bet on (red, blue, or tie). The dice are rolled and the outcome is determined. If the player wins, their balance is increased and the winnings are displayed. If the player loses, their balance is decreased and a message is displayed. The player can choose to play again or quit the game.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em player} & The player object for whom the game is being started. \\
