# Casino
Simple practising tool meant for fun and as a proof of concept

# How to play
At launch the program prompts you to enter your Username, as this is still a proof of concept, there is no way of registering or creating an instance of youself, thus you have to choose 1 from 1000 available in the `playerData.csv` file.

After successful login you can select one of the following options:

1. Double or Nothing (DorN)
    
     Simple coinflip game where you can select heads or tails and enter your desired bet amount.
2. BlackJack (BJ)
    
    Starts a BlackJack game and lets you enter your bet amount
3. Poker

    ***NOT IMPLEMENTED***
4. Dice

    Dice game where you can select tie, red or blue, whichever die rolls the highest wins or it's a tie
5. Roulette

    ***NOT IMPLEMENTED***
6. Get your balance report

    Writes out currently available balance to the player.
